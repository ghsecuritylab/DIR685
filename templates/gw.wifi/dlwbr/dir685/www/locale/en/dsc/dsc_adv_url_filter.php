<h1>Website Filter Rules </h1>
<p>
Website Filters are useful tools for restricting Internet access. The 
Website URL option allows you to quickly create a list of all web sites that you wish to allow
 or deny users from accessing. The Schedule option allows you to control when clients
 or PCs connected to the Router are allowed to access the Internet.
